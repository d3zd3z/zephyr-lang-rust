config RUST_ALLOC
	bool "Support an allocator in Rust code"
	help
	  If enabled, the Rust zephyr support library will include support for
	  an allocator.  This allocator will use the currently configured
	  Zephyr allocator (malloc/free).  With this enabled, Rust
	  applications can use the `alloc` crate.

config RUST_CHECK_KOBJ_INIT
        bool "Check at runtime that static kobjects are initialized"
        help
          If enabled, the static kobject support in Rust will use an atomic
          variable to check that the kobject has had the appropriate
          initialization done to it.

          This adds a 32-bit value to each kobject and requires that these kobjects be placed in zero
          initialized memory. Accesses to the shared variable will invoke an atomic read, and the
          initializer will have a few atomic operations.
